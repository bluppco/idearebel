    Design has evolved into a catch-all for several different disciplines including branding, environmental design, content production, webpage layout and graphic design – essentially, the aesthetic elements of pretty much everything. As a methodology, design thinking draws from this toolkit to integrate human need with technological possibility to achieve extraordinary results.

        Research suggests that 94% of online first impressions are design-related, indicating that consumers are becoming increasingly critical and expectant of design at every brand touchpoint. Design has to be free of experiential obstacles like excessive scrolling, clicking and reading, yet must also convey a sense of polish and professionalism that sets a brand apart from its competitors. In this sense, it’s almost impossible to divorce design’s function from its style.
