From apps to websites to Virtual Reality campaigns, everything we do at Idea Rebel is underpinned by the User Experience. That’s why it’s so gratifying when the industry recognizes us for UX; and while we’re still crossing our fingers for a win, we’re thrilled to announce that we’ve made the first cut as Finalists in the Vancouver User Experience Awards 2017!

\
In their own words, the goal of the awards is “recognizing joy, elegance, clarity, innovation and impact in the interactions we create.” This year, the award categories were redefined to better represent the breadth of great user experience work being done across BC’s Lower Mainland, and our entry, The Hyundai Canada Dealer’s App, is a current Finalist in the UX FOR WORK category!

\
We built the Hyundai Canada Dealer’s App for Hyundai Canada as a digital sales tool that adds ease and transparency to a historically challenging interaction. It showcases features of the Hyundai product family and identifies the brand’s advantages over any competitor vehicle on the market, for real-time comparison shopping.
