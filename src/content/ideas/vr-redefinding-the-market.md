How VR is redefining marketing and how we’re redefining VR

\
Virtual Reality: once the bailiwick of tech-heads and futurists, as theoretical as autonomous vehicles, nanosensors and next generation batteries – the Dorito-stained pipedream of basement-dwelling gamers the world over.  Not anymore.

\
Virtual Reality is here and it’s the game-changing next step in an evolving digital world. From product testing to in-store tours, VR provides customers with an enhanced experience, regardless of industry. But to truly understand Virtual Reality means framing it within the context of its predecessor – a technology that just happens to have our name all over it: 360° video.

\
BMW Becomes Electric

\
Idea Rebel was the first company in the world to implement 360° video in an app for the BMW Becomes Electric campaign. The iconic car manufacturer wanted to demo the innovative tech behind their latest line of luxury vehicles and needed a digital experience to match. Working with Tool of North America, we developed an app that leveraged the arrival of personal device VR and took immersive to a whole new level. Using 360° video footage connected to the phone’s accelerometer, we created a complete mobile VR experience, giving would-be Beemer owners the ability to experience any area of the footage by simply moving their device in physical space. Paired with a hyper-realistic soundscape, we gave users the sensation of driving the BMW i3 electric car. The award-winning first-of-its-kind app performed over 100,000 virtual test drives, ultimately promoting users to book a physical test drive with their local dealer. The app was a hit and the vehicle made an amazing global first impression. Then came VR…

\
In the past, the price tag was a valid obstacle to the widespread use of this technology but with the emergence of hardware like Samsung’s Gear VR, Oculus Rift, Sony Playstation VR and Google Cardboard, Virtual Reality experiences are accessible to almost everyone. These days, you can’t throw an iPhone 5 without hitting a VR marketing campaign. The reality (ironically) is that Virtual Reality is a technology that’s increasingly becoming a part of our everyday lives. So, what sets Idea Rebel’s VR projects apart? Our experience. Cases in point:

\
Infiniti Driver’s Seat

\
When you’re competing with the likes of BMW, Mercedes and Audi, outshining the competition takes some pretty amazing work. Infiniti wanted to leverage their latest concept cars to a wider audience, re-enforcing their aspirational luxury brand image beyond the confines of the auto show circuit. We created Infiniti’s Driver’s Seat, a Virtual Reality app that gives users the only set of keys to the QX30 and Q60 concept cars via two immersive VR experiences. The reception was overwhelmingly positive, with the app receiving massive amounts of attention both on-site at Pebble Beach and online by industry and consumer publications.

\
Converse In Their Chucks

\
Ever walked a mile in someone else’s shoes? Converse asked us to help develop a VR promotion as the standard bearer for their latest global campaign, Made By You. We created a Virtual Reality app that celebrated the creativity and diversity behind this iconic sneaker brand by putting users in the shoes of four particular Chuck Taylor fans. Leaning on our mobile technology chops, we created an experience that features a unique 3D world that can be explored by simply moving a device in your hands. Owners of Google Cardboard can explore the app in a truly immersive way. Our innovation has helped Converse showcase the creativity their fans have been expressing in their Chucks for nearly a century.

\
Ford VR

\
America’s favourite vehicle manufacturer wanted to implement a new way of showcasing their innovative technologies and high-adrenalin events. The objective was to provide the exhilarating behind-the-scenes experience of test-driving the 2017 Ford GT in the iconic Le Mans Race. Again partnering with Tool of North America, we developed FordVR, an immersive VR app for Google Cardboard and the Samsung Gear VR headset. This beauty uses stunning 360-degree video to provide VIP access to Ford events, using innovative mobile device compatibilities that put users in the passenger’s seat with World Rallycross stars Ken Block and Andreas Bakkeurd. Users loved the experience, and since we built this with content editing capabilities, the opportunities are endless!
