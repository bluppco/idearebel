Idea Rebel developed a website dedicated to showing how John F Kennedy and his ideas, continue to inspire and affect the present world.

\
John F Kennedy was the 35th president of the United States of America. He was tragically taken from the world on November 22nd 1963. Through this website, the John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum is committed to exposing how the late Presidents ideas live on in current society. The website contains a collection of touching stories from a variety of people who have been inspired by JFK, and encourages users to submit their own stories as well. The website creates a community-like feel and a platform for users to voice their own personal anecdotes about how JFK has influenced their everyday life.

\
The website was so well received that it won an FWA Award for website of the day.
