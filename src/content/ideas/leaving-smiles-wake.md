This summer, Idea Rebel again coordinated with Big Brothers of Greater Vancouver to host Wake Day – an event in Ladner BC that gives kids the opportunity to wakeboard in the gorgeous southern estuary of the Fraser River.

With Jamie and Neil from IR providing lessons and demonstrations, seven Little Brothers (accompanied by their Big Brothers) spent the day swimming, boating and wakeboarding, with other Rebels on hand to make it a day to remember for everyone. This year, none of the kids had been wakeboarding before, so it was especially impressive that they ALL managed to get up on the board and experience one of BC’s favourite watersports.

With warm weather, loads of snacks and great company, Wake Day 2017 was definitely one of the highlights of our summer. Big thanks again to Big Brothers of Vancouver, for partnering again to help Idea Rebel with yet another awesome event!
