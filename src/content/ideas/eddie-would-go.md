Our team at Idea Rebel joined forces with Quiksilver to remember the legacy of Eddie Aikau. We developed a user experience to promote the 28th annual “Eddie”, a tribute to the lost surfer.

\
Eddie is a surfing legend whose spirit has been an inspiration. To celebrate his legacy, Quiksilver has invited users to nominate a personal hero who embodies Eddie’s spirit. Once nominated, you are entered into a draw to win an all-expense paid trip to the Eddie Opening Ceremony in Hawaii and a $1,000 shopping spree at the Quiksilver in Waikiki.

\
The second part of the Eddie Would Go project is a photo contest where users upload Instagram photos with the hashtag #eddiewouldgo. When you upload your photo your entered into a chance to win a weekly Eddie prize pack.

\
We’re stoked to have the chance to work with Quiksilver on such a notable contest. Most importantly, Quiksilver is donating $1 for every nomination and photo upload to Kokua Hawaii Foundation. It always feels good to give back!
