\
That list goes on and on day by day. The world is changing, and it is changing faster than we expected.

\
There is even an Earth 2.0 where you can own, buy and sell land!

\
In 2022, VR revenues are expected to climb to 6.71 billion U.S. dollars, and by 2024 it will double the amount and hit 12.19.

\
And if you wonder how many people play roblox, the number hit 202 MILLION in April 2021.

\
Marketers have been waiting for years for consumer VR and AR technology to take off, and now it’s finally **here**.

\
The future of marketing will be a wild ride as we adapt to new ways of reaching consumers through **virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality.**

\
These technologies will bring us closer to the consumer than ever before by putting them right in the middle of our message.

\
It’s going to change everything about how we think about marketing. Now, let’s proceed to the new world—**the Metaverse**.


## What Is The Metaverse?

\
Do you know Van Gogh’s immersive experience in which you can physically experience the paintings with the help of augmented reality?

\
There are 360-degree projections and VR glasses that enable you to immerse yourself in those fantastic paintings fully.

\
**Now, imagine you don’t even have to leave your house for this kind of experience. You don’t even have to move from your comfortable couch.**

\
How? Via The Metaverse.

\
The word **“Metaverse”** was made up of the prefix **“meta”** ( beyond) and the **“verse”** (from “universe”). The term “metaverse” was coined by Neal Stephenson in his science fiction novel Snow Crash, published in 1992.

\
“The Metaverse is a hypothesized iteration of the internet, supporting persistent online 3-D virtual environments through conventional personal computing, as well as virtual and augmented reality headsets.”

\
The Metaverse will be a place where users can access and interact via virtual reality or augmented reality.

\
With this technology, people will be able to participate in social activities and entertainment like never before.

\
Metaverse is built upon the concepts of presence, immersion, and interactivity.

\
The Metaverse has been described as a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet.
## Characteristics Of The Metaverse

\
Take a look at the characteristics of the Metaverse to have a better understanding.

- **Persistent:** The Metaverse is an entirely immersive, shared experience. It will be a parallel reality that exists in real-time and never stops.
- **Synch:** In the Metaverse, users will interact with one another and their digital environment in real-time. Just like they would in the physical world, participants of the Metaverse will react to their virtual environment and each other.
- **User-driven:** In Metaverse, users can create their content, or they can enhance existing content.
- **Efficient-Economy:** Metaverse will have fully functioning economies based on non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrency, and more.

## Decentralized Vs. Centralized Worlds

\
To better understand the Metaverse, let’s also take a look at the **decentralized** and **centralized** world concepts.

\
For instance, say you are using a social media platform like Facebook or Youtube. It means you are using a **centralized** system – in which central authority is in control of the data.

\
For example, if you want to share a post with your friend via Facebook, they will know that you are sending it, and the data will be verified and transferred by Facebook.

\
That means in a centralized world, centralized platforms like Facebook have the control.

\
What about a **decentralized** world?

\
The idea of the decentralized world came into our lives with the release of **bitcoin** in 2009.

\
With the help of blockchain technology, if you want to send bitcoin to your friend, it doesn’t have to go through the same steps in a centralized system.

\
**Blockchain** is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.

\
You know the difference between the decentralized and centralized worlds now. What about the **Metaverse?** Is it in the decentralized or centralized world?

\
Today, the Metaverse can be put in between these two worlds.

\
Let’s say you are a Roblox player. If you purchase a good in Roblox, you can not take that item to another virtual place.

\
Roblox or Fortnite still count as a part of the Metaverse since those virtual environments have Metaverse characteristics.

\
Don’t worry, though; we are so close to a fully decentralized world.
## Fungible and Non-fungible Tokens

\
We know what blockchain and the decentralized world mean at this point. What else should we familiarize ourselves with?

\
**Tokens.** Tokens refer to the data stored on the blockchain ledger.

\
Consumers will engage with brands and each other in the Metaverse, so it is essential to understand tokens.

\
There are two types of tokens: **Fungible and Non-fungible.**

\
**Fungible** means something that can be exchanged for another item of the same kind.

\
For example, a dollar bill is fungible because it can be exchanged with any other dollar bill.

\
Digital items such as Bitcoin are also fungible because they can be interchanged with each other.

\
**Non-Fungible** means that the digital item is unique, one of a kind.

\
An excellent example of this is CryptoKitties, an Ethereum based game where users can buy and trade virtual cats.

\
“Each cat is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by you; it cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed.” So, an **NFT** is a Non-Fungible Token that is secured on the blockchain. It is important to know these terms to have a better understanding of metaverse marketing.
## Marketing In The Metaverse

\
What about digital marketing in the Metaverse? **“Metaverse Marketing”** is the digital marketing of the future.

\
Metaverse is a new marketing ecosystem that works like the blockchain.

\
It’s decentralized, so it has no servers or administrators. It is a new marketing strategy that allows you to connect with your customer base in ways that have never been possible before.

\
Metaverse Marketing will change the way you think about digital marketing.
## Is Your Brand Ready for the Metaverse?

\
If you’re reading this blog post, you are interested in learning more about metaverse and metaverse marketing opportunities.

\
And you probably heard that Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduced Meta, which brings together apps and technologies under one new company brand.

\
ADJUST BRAND STRATEGY :

\
Meta’s focus will be to bring the Metaverse to life and help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses.

\
However, as I mentioned before in the article, Facebook is a centralized platform, and they are not exactly planning to be fully decentralized.

\
If they want to be fully decentralized, they would need to adjust their centralized model.

\
But, again, the Metaverse does not necessarily be decentralized as in the Fortnite example.

\
Therefore, they would need to adapt their business models and goals parallel to Metaverse if you want a successful metaverse marketing strategy.

\
CHANGE OF MINDSET :

\
Your company and people need a mindset that believes that Metaverse and virtual environments are places for consumer attention and commerce.

\
It is not something that will come and go away.

\
This mindset enables these companies to build highly relevant and long-term positions rather than short-term executions that offer less brand equity.

\
HIRE TECH HUNTERS :

\
Your brand should also have people who determine what can be improved in their industry and incorporate new technology.

\
Then, those brands will shape the future with immersive technology.

\
LAUNCH NFTs :

\
In 2021, the global gaming market was worth about $61 billion.

\
The in-game purchase market value is projected to be $74.4 billion by 2025. It is fair to say that as a society, we are spending a lot of money online, and we value digital assets more than ever.(Remember the Gucci Bag example mentioned above)

\
In the Metaverse, there are non-fungible tokens that enable virtual ownership of the asset.

\
Therefore, brands may also need to launch NFT editions – such as NBA Top Shot, where you can collect and trade officially licensed NBA and WNBA NFTs.

\
CREATE VIRTUAL SHOWS / VSTORES :

\
Your brand can create virtual shows, showcases, events, and more. You can also partner with an existing virtual platform like Roblox example or Coca-Cola.

\
They launched virtual wearable NFTs- including a wearable jacket in the Decentraland metaverse. This was Coca-Cola’s first NFT collection.

\
CREATE 3D MODELS :

\
3D models are fundamental to creating immersive content.

\
With the rise of VR, 3D models have become an essential tool for creating rich interactive experiences.

\
As more industries adopt VR as a standard, there will be an increasing demand for 3D models that can be used to create these immersive environments.

\
There are many ways to adapt your company and brand to the Metaverse.

\
And keep in mind that it is just a beginning; there will be more options to find your way in.

\
As a marketer, you will need to be prepared for the changes it brings.

## Advertising and The Metaverse

\
Like the shift from tv, radio, and banner advertising to social media, search engines, and others, we are now shifting from digital advertising to metaverse marketing.

\
Today, businesses in display advertising that we can locate on google or other search engines use words and supporting graphics.

\
However, these graphics will become 3D with the industry’s shift, making the work a little tricky.

\
In addition, VR and AR will be prevalent methods, and they will require creative work even more than today.

\
However, this is going to give digital marketers more freedom in how they advertise and sell products.
## Search Engine Optimization and the Metaverse

\
Search engine optimization might change substantially with the rise of Metaverse.

\
We are not quite sure what will happen to SEO, unfortunately.

\
Google might adopt a more **immersive** approach – they might offer a search engine where you can visit the website via VR.

\
“Brands will need to rethink their narratives in three dimensions, and marketers will need to embrace emerging technology at a faster speed.

\
In the Metaverse, everyone is a world builder, including brands.”- Cathy Hackl.
## Social Media Marketing and The Metaverse

\
What will happen to social media in the Metaverse?

\
We can say the social media platforms may look like Roblox or Fortnite, where you would have a 3D character in AR and visit websites like visiting game rooms in a game.

\
The possibilities are endless. AR and VR will impact the customer journey from the first step to the last.
## Content Marketing and The Metaverse

\
Only 3 percent of the content on the internet is **“interactive”** content.

\
This means that everything else on the web is passive- photos, videos, etc. In interactive graphics, the graphics change according to the user’s actions on it.

\
Interactive content allows for exploration and discovery, parallel to metaverse characteristics, such as user-driven characteristics.

\
Brand experiences that tie in with real-world experiences or parallel what your brand already does in real life can help you connect with consumers.

\
**The Metaverse is still a new concept to all marketers, which enables experimentations and unique approaches.**

\
The future of marketing is on the Metaverse. It’s essential to start planning your brand’s path to success on the Metaverse **now.**

\
A **Metaverse** is an exciting place where users can create, experience, and share new realities.

\
In this guide, we’ve provided you with some tips on how you can leverage the potential of virtual reality for your marketing efforts.

\
We hope they have been helpful! If you would like to talk more about what the future of marketing will look like, please let us know by liking or sharing 🙂
