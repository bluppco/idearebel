Jamie had the honour of speaking at the Ernst & Young (EY) Entrepreneur of the Year Thought Leadership Event, hosted by BC Business Magazine. The event was held at Audi Vancouver, where a room full of Vancouver’s most prominent business professionals had the opportunity to discuss a variety of topics from philanthropy to wealth and personal experiences. Jamie, alongside Roger Hardy (Coastal Contacts Founder), took the stands to shed some light on why E-Commerce should be handled the same way as traditional commerce and also spoke about some of his own experiences in the tech industry. With cutting edge thinking and real world experience shared, you couldn’t help but feel inspired. Overall, the night provided individuals the opportunity to share ideas and learn from one another. We hope to come back next year!
