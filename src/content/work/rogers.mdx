            ## The Idea

            \
            We innovated and produced a simple, logical, fantasy sports game that let hockey viewers from coast to coast play simply and easily – all they had to do was pick a single player from each of nine NHL pairings every week for a chance to win one of two brand new Kia cars. With a single sign-in and simple tie-breaker, Hockey Night in Canada Pick’n Play was an easy, efficient and exciting solution. Best of all, it was designed to be fully responsive and device agnostic – an amazing single-platform experience on any device.
