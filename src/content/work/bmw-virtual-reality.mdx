            BMW wanted to demonstrate the innovative technologies behind their vehicles, and needed a digital experience to match. Idea Rebel took on the challenge, working with Tool of North America on an app development project that took immersive experience to a whole new level.

            ## The Idea

            \
            Utilizing 360° video footage connected to the phone accelerometer, we provided users with a completely mobile VR driving experience, giving them the ability to move the phone in their own physical space to experience different areas of the footage. This innovative viewing technology was coupled with a realistic soundscape, providing users with the feeling of being in the driver’s seat of their own BMW i3 electric car.

                ## Results

                \
                The award-winning first-of-its-kind app performed over one hundred thousand virtual test drives, ultimately directing users to book a physical test drive with their local BMW dealer. The app and story were a hit, and the car made a global first impression.
