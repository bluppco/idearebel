Colourful and playful, each detail of this dynamic, customized experience was scrutinized and measured like any other world-class digital property.

        ## Results

        Squeezing the most out of 7eleven.ca required expertise in all facets of digital. We succeeded in connecting consumers with the iconic brand by understanding how and why they interact with the company’s Canadian web property, presenting the value proposition in a manner that users found relevant and engaging. The results were immediate and revenue began to climb sharply, spurring a redesign of slurpee.ca as an eye-popping experience skewed towards younger target segments.
