14.2 You agree that any material breach of Sections 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10 of the Terms will result in irreparable harm to Idea Rebel for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, Idea Rebel will be entitled to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs. You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if Idea Rebel seeks such an injunction.

14.3 British Columbia law and controlling Canadian law govern any action related to the Terms and/or Your use of the Website. Choice of law rules of any jurisdiction.

Factors that may cause such a difference include risks related to adverse changes in general economic conditions, failure to reduce costs, lack of success in technical advancements, the timely development, production and acceptance of new products and services, and Idea Rebel’ ability to compete in a highly competitive and rapidly changing marketplace.

14.7 Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under the Terms will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation of non-enforcement.
