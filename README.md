# idearebel

## Changes
1. Irregular next/previous project link in ideas.
2. Career page loading through JS. Have created seperate pages- :location:/:job-title: format.
3. Team member endpoint to be changed to team-member from teammember.


### Footer
1. Since the clocks are analogue, it wasn't sure if it was day time or night time. Added AM/PM.
2. Text "Idea Rebel" over locations was looking redundant, hence removed.
3. Twitter logo change.
4. Clocks were not considering daylight saving on/off time. Added this logic to subtract 1hour when DLS is not used.
